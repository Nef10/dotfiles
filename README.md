# Dotfiles

My dotfiles, inspried by https://github.com/sam-hosseini/dotfiles and https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles. The terminal theme is based on https://github.com/nathanbuchar/atom-one-dark-terminal.

## Use

To install use the following line at own risk
```
curl --silent https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nef10/dotfiles/master/setup-mac-os.sh | bash
```
Please note that the set up is indented for `zsh`. If your MacOS user was created before Catalina you might want to switch your shell to take ful advantage of these dotfiles.
