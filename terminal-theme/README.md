# Terminal Theme

This terminal theme is based on https://github.com/nathanbuchar/atom-one-dark-terminal with some minor modifications.

## Use

The theme will be installed by the macOS defaults script by adding the content of the dict inside `atom-one-dark.terminal` into the correct Terminal defaults. If you want to install it manually either open the file or go to the Terminal settings and select import.

## Adjust

To adjust the theme, first install it, then change it in the settings of the terminal app. Finally you can export it into a new `.terminal` directly from the settings.
